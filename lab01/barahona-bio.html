        Hi, my name is Sebastian Barahona-Gonzalez. I’m currently majoring in Computer Science interested in becoming a fullstack web developer. I’m currently working on learning C++, Python, and SQL. When I’m not working on programming I enjoy hanging out with friends, playing basketball, and going to the gym.
